## Description

This is an employee tracker connected to the mySQL database. My motivation wanting to understand how asynchronous code works and why it would be used. I built this to have an understanding of not only SQL, but how to connect it to node. This allows coordination and organization of data. I learned the importance of understanding how asynchronous code works especially when you are waiting for data to come back from another source.
